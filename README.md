## Description
This repository contains a C++ assignment focused on implementing various algorithms and data structures. The project aims to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic concepts through practical coding exercises.

## Cases
The assignment includes the following cases:

- Case 1 — Input validation and student grading helper (`Case1.cpp`). Prompts for a course name, student NPM, and a numeric grade; validates inputs (non-empty strings and non-negative grade) and prints the assigned grade message or an error if inputs are incomplete.

- Case 2 — Passing grade checker (`Case2.cpp`). Reads a numeric grade and prints whether the student passes based on a minimum passing grade (75).

- Case 3 — Numeric-to-letter grade converter (`Case3.cpp`). Converts a numeric grade into a letter grade (A/B/C/D/E) using range checks and prints the corresponding letter.

- Case 4 — Coffee machine menu using `switch` (`Case4.cpp`). Displays a menu of coffees (Cappucino, Amerikano, Espresso, Late, Moccacino), reads a user choice, and prints the purchase confirmation or an unavailable-message.

- Case 5 — Simple ATM menu using `switch` (`Case5.cpp`). Provides ATM-like options: check balance, withdraw, deposit, and transfer. Handles user input for amounts, validates sufficient balance for withdrawals/transfers, and updates the balance accordingly.
